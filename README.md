Showcasing and documenting my 2025 National Cyber League Capture the Flag experience. 

🛡️ National Cyber League — Fall 2025
I competed in the Fall 2025 National Cyber League (NCL) season, participating in both the Individual Game and Team Game. These challenges tested practical cybersecurity skills across nine categories including OSINT, Log Analysis, Scanning & Recon, Password Cracking, Cryptography, Forensics, Web Exploitation, and Enumeration & Exploitation. I participated as stutent of SANS Technology Institute — B.S. Applied Cybersecurity 

This summary highlights my strongest demonstrated skills, tools used, and areas I am actively improving.

🚀 Performance Overview
-Individual Game
  -603rd of 7,873 players (93rd percentile)
  -1,930/3,000 points, 72% completion, 63.5% accuracy
  -Top Categories:
    -Log Analysis – 98th percentile
    -Open Source Intelligence – 97th percentile
    -Enumeration & Exploitation – 93rd percentile
-Team Game
  -245th of 4,214 teams (95th percentile)
  -Contributed strongly to team success in OSINT, Network Traffic Analysis, and Forensics.

🧰 Core Competencies
-Log Analysis (Major Strength)
  -Demonstrated strong performance across all log analysis challenges.
  -Tools & methods used:
    -Manual/visual log parsing
    -Linux CLI: cat, grep, awk, sort, uniq
    -jq for structured JSON review
    -Identifying brute-force patterns, malicious process chains, and fraudulent activity in complex log formats
-Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
  -High accuracy and completion in OSINT tasks utilizing publicly available data and metadata.
  -Tools & methods used:
    -Google Dorking
    -Google Lens
    -EXIF extraction (exiftool)
    -SEC EDGAR database GUI
    -AI-assisted reasoning (ChatGPT, Claude)
-Scanning & Reconnaissance
  -Strong capability in discovering services, analyzing code repositories, and identifying exposed assets.
  -Tools & methods used:
    -Git commands for commit history review and secret identification
    -Service enumeration and open-port discovery
    -DNS record discovery
    -General reconnaissance methodology
-Enumeration & Exploitation
  -High proficiency in analyzing source code, identifying vulnerabilities, and exploiting them where required.
  -Notable accomplishments:
    -Command injection exploitation
    -Binary/compiled code analysis
    -Stack-triggered behavior testing
    -Privilege escalation within challenge constraints

🔐 Additional Technical Skills Utilized
-Cryptography
  -Experienced with:
  -CyberChef (From Binary, From Charcode, From Hex, Base64, ROT, Vigenère, Baconian)
  -Basic code analysis to understand cipher operations
  -XOR, weak-key DES analysis (per challenge)
-Password Cracking
  -Hands-on experience with:
  -CyberChef for hash identification
  -Hashcat (including mask attacks)
  -OphCrack (rainbow tables)
  -John the Ripper
  -pdf2john for extracting PDF hash material
-Network Traffic Analysis
  -Used Wireshark to analyze packet captures and identify suspicious downloads, malicious behavior, or obfuscated traffic patterns.
-Web Application Exploitation
  -Intermediate experience using:
  -Browser Developer Tools
  -Early-stage learning with Burp Suite

⚠️ Areas for Continued Improvement
-Forensics
  -While foundational tasks were completed, more advanced forensics tasks (image repair, SQLite recovery, custom file structure reconstruction) remain a growth area.
  -Focus moving forward: deeper filesystem forensics, corrupted file recovery, data carving.

🌐 Web Application Exploitation
  -Individual performance shows need for increased depth in SQL injection, prototype pollution, XXE, and chained exploitation.
  -Focus moving forward: Burp Suite workflows, backend enumeration, multi-stage exploit chaining.
